## Step 1 - Create Dockerfile
Docker Images start from a base image. The base image should include the platform dependencies required by your application, for example, having the JVM or CLR installed.

This base image is defined as an instruction in the Dockerfile. Docker Images are built based on the contents of a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is a list of instructions describing how to deploy your application.

In this example, our base image is the Alpine version of Nginx. This provides the configured web server on the Linux Alpine distribution.

Task
Create your Dockerfile for building your image by copying the contents below into the editor.

    Copy to EditorFROM nginx:alpine
    COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

The first line defines our base image. The second line copies the content of the current directory into a particular location inside the container.

## Step 2 - Build Docker Image
The Dockerfile is used by the Docker CLI build command. The build command executes each instruction within the Dockerfile. The result is a built Docker Image that can be launched and run your configured app.

The build command takes in some different parameters. The format is docker build -t <build-directory>. The -t parameter allows you to specify a friendly name for the image and a tag, commonly used as a version number. This allows you to track built images and be confident about which version is being started.

Task
Build our static HTML image using the build command below.

    docker build -t webserver-image:v1 .

You can view a list of all the images on the host using docker images.

The built image will have the name webserver-image with a tag of v1.

## Step 3 - Run
The built Image can be launched in a consistent way to other Docker Images. When a container launches, it's sandboxed from other processes and networks on the host. When starting a container you need to give it permission and access to what it requires.

For example, to open and bind to a network port on the host you need to provide the parameter -p <host-port>:<container-port>.

Task
Launch our newly built image providing the friendly name and tag. As it's a web server, bind port 80 to our host using the -p parameter.

    docker run -d -p 80:80 webserver-image:v1

Once started, you'll be able to access the results of port 80 via curl docker

You now have a static HTML website being served by Nginx.
